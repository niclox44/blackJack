🃏 Blackjack (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the development of a Blackjack game implemented in C++ (or whichever language you are using).
The project is not finished yet, but it already includes part of the core logic and the main structure of the game.

🚧 Project Status

🔧 In development
Several important features are still missing or incomplete. Some parts of the code may change as the project evolves.
The final goal is to build a fully functional and expandable Blackjack game.

▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackjack.git
2. Compile: make 
3. Run the server: ./server.exe
4. If you want to play you will need execute two clients at least: /client.exe

📌 Final Goal

- The long-term objective is to create a modular and readable Blackjack game that can be expanded with:
- Multiplayer mode
- Graphical interface
- Different rule sets (European, Vegas, Atlantic City…)
- Simulation mode for statistics
